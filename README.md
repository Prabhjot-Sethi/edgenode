# MEC Appliance Community Edition

This repository contains the project for the MEC Appliance Community Edition.

## Getting started

It is recommended that you become familiar with our documentation to learn more about multi-access edge computing (MEC). This project has a companion project, the MEC Controller Community Edition. While a MEC Appliance can operate independently of a MEC Controller, the two projects are co-contributed to allow for a one-to-many deployment environment.

## Project structure

As a primarily Go project, this project adopts structures similar to other Go projects. See [Golang project layout standards](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) to get familiar. We will do our best to label directories for clarification. In lieu of a flushed out contributing guide, this shall serve as the project's standards along with [Go's standards](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).
